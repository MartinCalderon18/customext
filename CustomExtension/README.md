# Azure DevOps Web Sample Extension

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/azure-devops-extension-sample/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.azure-devops-extension-sample)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/azure-devops-extension-sample/_build/latest?definitionId=14)

This repository generates an [Azure DevOps extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/overview?view=vsts) containing a number of different contributions of various types.

## Dependencies

The sample repository depends on a few Azure DevOps packages:

- [azure-devops-extension-sdk](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sdk): Required module for Azure DevOps extensions which allows communication between the host page and the extension iframe.
- [azure-devops-extension-api](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-extension-api): Contains REST client libraries for the various Azure DevOps feature areas.
- [azure-devops-ui](https://developer.microsoft.com/azure-devops): UI library containing the React components used in the Azure DevOps web UI.

Some external dependencies:
- `React` - Is used to render the UI in the samples, and is a dependency of `azure-devops-ui`.
- `TypeScript` - Samples are written in TypeScript and complied to JavaScript
- `SASS` - Extension samples are styled using SASS (which is compiled to CSS and delivered in webpack js bundles).
- `webpack` - Is used to gather dependencies into a single javascript bundle for each sample.

## Building the sample project

Just run:

    npm run build

This produces a .vsix file which can be uploaded to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops)

## Using the extension

The preferred way to get started is to use the `tfx extension init` command which will clone from this sample and prompt you for replacement information (like your publisher id). Just run:

    npm install -g tfx-cli
    tfx extension init

You can also clone the sample project and change the `publisher` property in `azure-devops-extension.json` to your own Marketplace publisher id. Refer to the online [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?view=vsts) for setting up your own publisher and publishing an extension.

# Samples

Individual sample contributions are self-contained folders under `./src/Samples`. Within each sample you will find:
1. `{SampleName}.json` - describes the contribution objects being added to Azure DevOps
2. `{SampleName}.html` - page which is rendered within an iframe on the appropriate Azure DevOps page or pages. It may be visible UI (such as a Hub) or a background iframe (such as a Menu action handler). This will include a sample reference for `{SampleName}.js`, and for visible frames it will contain a single `<div>` element with an id of `root`.
3. `{SampleName}.ts(x)` - Root script that is run when the frame is loaded. A webpack entry is added for this file which will generate a single `js` file with this content and all its dependencies.
4. `{SampleName}.scss` - optional sass file containing the styles (CSS) for the UI
5. Additional ts/tsx files - For samples that are too big for one file, the code will be broken up appropriately

## BreadcrumbService

This sample adds a breadcrumb service which adds a "Sample Breadcrumb Item" global breadcrumb item to the sample hub.  Visit the "Sample Hub" in the `Pipelines` hub group to see this item.

## Hub

This sample adds a hub named "Sample Hub" into the `Pipelines` hub group. If you visit a project-level page, you will find Sample Hub under the `Pipelines` navigation element in the vertical navigation menu on the left of the page.

The hub uses a Pivot component to draw 4 different tabs:
1. An `Overview` tab contains some simple details about the current user and project
2. A `Navigation` tab contains a few actions that allow you to integrate with the page's URL and title
3. An `Extension Data` tab demonstrates reading and writing to the extension data service
4. A `Messages` tab shows how to display global messages

There are also actions at the top-right of the hub which demonstrate opening dialogs and panels, including custom content within them (used in the `Panel` sample).
